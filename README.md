# Hotel Revenue
## 🎯 Objective
The client’s brief focused on three main questions:
- How much is our year-on-year revenue growing across the two hotels?
- Should we increase our parking capacity?
- What trends can be identified in the data?

## 🔍 Dataset Overview
The dataset was first loaded into SQL for database creation and performing of exploratory data analysis (EDA) and an interactive Power BI dashboard was developed for the client, allowing filtering by guest country of origin, hotel type, and arrival date. This enables deeper, self-driven analysis for follow-up questions. The dashboard and analysis addressed each part of the brief:

-----
📈 Revenue Growth:
- Revenue increased from £1.1M in 2018 to £5.5M in 2019, with £3.5M year-to-date in 2020.
- Projected 2020 revenue is £5.9M, estimated by extrapolating data based on revenue from January to August in previous years, as the dataset ends in August 2020.
- Overall, this indicates a slight year-on-year growth in revenue across the business.

Revenue distribution by hotel:
- In 2018, the Resort Hotel contributed 65% of total revenue.
- In 2019 and 2020, the City Hotel consistently accounts for around 56% of total revenue, indicating a shift in performance.

-----
🅿️ Parking Requirements:

Analysis of parking usage shows no indication of the need for increased parking capacity:
- City Hotel: Average parking usage is approximately 2%
- Resort Hotel: Average usage is around 6.5%

These low parking space occupancy rates suggest that current facilities are sufficient for both hotels.

-----
📊 Other trends in the data:

- City Hotel revenue remains fairly consistent throughout the year, and generally outperforms the Resort Hotel except in summer.
- Resort Hotel revenue spikes significantly in summer, aided by higher room prices during peak months.
- The average discount across both hotels is 26%, and this remains stable year-round.

These trends suggest seasonal pricing strategies and guest preferences may be playing a major role in revenue performance.
